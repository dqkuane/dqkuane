- I'm dqkuane. 
- I'm interested in algorithmic trading and quantifying things that are hard to quantify. 
  - Looking at valuation modelling, private equity modelling, quantitative finance.
  - Very interested by innovative arbitrage opportunities like the Kimchi Premium.
  - Long term project is to bridge data gaps in Private Equity.
  - Long term goal is to run my own quant fund.
- I'm currently learning C#, R, and C++.
- I'm experienced in python. Familiar libraries: numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, statsmodels, matplotlib.pyplot, seaborn, yfinance.
- I'm also experienced in Java.
- I'm working on machine learning, neural networks, deep learning atm. Trying to apply it to algo trading. Still in the basic stages rn but as I learn more about quantitative finance I'll be putting out more advanced modelling.
